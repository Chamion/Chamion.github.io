      <p>
        I've recently fallen in love with the delightful expressiveness of the JavaScript <code>void</code> operator.
        If you don't know what the <code>void</code> operator is you can read about it in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void">MDN</a> but you don't need to know anything to understand this article.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Expressiveness">Expressiveness</h2>
      <p>
        Taka a look at the following example usage.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
const handleEvent = event => void sideEffect(event);
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        Even if you've never seen a <code>void</code> operator used in javascript you can likely tell <code>handleEvent</code> always returns <code>undefined</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same code without the void operator would look like this.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
const handleEvent = event => {
  sideEffect(event);
};
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        I claim the former is more expressive than the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of lines has nothing to do with it.
        We could write a one-liner without the void operator.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
const handleEvent = event => { sideEffect(event); };
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        The reason <code>void</code> is more expressive lies in the specificity of the syntax.
        <code>void</code> is only ever used for voiding the value of an expression.
        An arrow function body can be used to void a value but it can also be used to group statements of a function.
        Voiding a value is the only possible reason a developer would ever use the <code>void</code> operator.
        It eliminates ambiquity from the code while a function body leaves some in.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Maintainability">Maintainability</h2>
      <p>
        Expressive code is easier to maintain and less prone to regression.
        Let's assume our <code>handleEvent</code> example goes through some changes, as code tends to do.
        It's extended with another function call statement.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
const handleEvent = event => {
  sideEffect(event);
  otherSideEffect(event);
};
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        Let's say <code>otherSideEffect</code> wasn't the greatest feature and soon it's removed again.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
const handleEvent = event => sideEffect(event);
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        Whoops!
        We've introduced regression.
        <code>handleEvent</code> now returns the return value of <code>sideEffect</code> instead of <code>undefined</code>.
        Of course ultimately the developer who made the last change is at fault but I'm scarcely interested in the blame game when we can prevent regression by writing expressive code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say we wrote <code>handleEvent</code> using the <code>void</code> operator instead.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
const handleEvent = event => void (
  sideEffect(event),
  otherSideEffect(event)
);
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        The natural, <strong>unambiguous</strong> way to remove <code>otherSideEffect</code> is to revert back to the original.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
const handleEvent = event => void sideEffect(event);
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        No developer is ever going to mess up that change.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Typescript">Typescript</h2>
      <p>
        Void return types are susceptible to falling through the cracks of TypeScript's type checking. It's not Typescript's fault.
        The types <code>void</code> and <code>undefined</code> are commonly used interchangeably and for an arguably good reason.
        If the value is voided then <code>void</code> is semantically correct.
        It makes APIs less strict and therefore reduces time spent resolving tiresome type errors.
        It comes with its price, though, which I already elucidated in the regression example above.
        The <code>void</code> operator gives us the flexibilty of the <code>void</code> type and the safety of <code>undefined</code>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Abuse">Abuse</h2>
      <p>
        I've only covered the <code>void</code> operator in the context of voiding side effect return values.
        I've done so because that's the only appropriate use of <code>void</code> in source code.
        In addition to function calls, like the cases I showed in examples, object property mutations are an appropriate use of <code>void</code> as they always have side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have seen <code>void</code> used in minified code to denote <code>undefined</code> using less characters: <code>void 0</code>.
        Any case where the expression being voided does not potentially create side effects is only appropriate in transpilers and code golf.
