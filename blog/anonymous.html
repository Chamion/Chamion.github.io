        Think about some of the bad variable names you've encountered in code (yours or someone else's) and the trouble they gave you.
        You have likely encountered overly generic names, shorthand names (sometimes just one character) and flat out wrong or misleading names.
        However, one variable name causes more confusion than any other and since you've already read the title you know I'm talking about anonymous: the omission of a name.
        Let's contrast appropriate and inappropriate uses of anonymous values.
      </p>
      <h2>Is the role immediately obvious?</h2>
      <p>
        I've noticed in my time of reviewing code that senior developers tend to use much fewer "elegant one-liners" than juniors.
        That is to say, experienced developers tend to interrupt the flow of functions and expressions to insert variable declarations.
        The purpose of these variable declarations is to give a name to an intermediate value used in a calculation.
        By naming intermediate values whose role is not immediately obvious the author makes the code more verbose but also more readable.
        Specifically, a value whose role is not <strong>immediately obvious</strong> should have a name to ensure good readability.
        "Immediately obvious" is a subjective term. Let's look at some examples to elucidate the matter.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
function incrementNumber(input) {
  return input + 1;
}
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        In this function declaration the value <code>1</code> is anonymous.
        Let's give it a name.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
var INCREMENT = 1;
function incrementNumber(input) {
  return input + INCREMENT;
}
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        Did we improve the readability of the code?
        I would argue we did not.
        We gave a name to a variable whose role was already immediately obvious.
        We increased verbosity and cluttered the code with unimportant information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
function validateId(id) {
  return /[\da-fA-F]{32}/.test(id);
};
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        In this function declaration the regular expression <code>/[\da-fA-F]{32}/</code> is anonymous.
        Let's give it a name.
      </p>
      <code>
<pre>
var 32_DIGIT_HEXADECIMAL_PATTERN = /[\da-fA-F]{32}/;
function validateId(id) {
  return 32_DIGIT_HEXADECIMAL_PATTERN.test(id);
};
</pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        Did we improve the readability now?
        I would argue we did.
        Even someone fluent in regular expressions is likely faster at reading and understanding the named version.
        On top of that, the name communicates to the reader the intentions of the author.
        In the named version it is clear that the author intended the function to validate an id to be a string representation of a hexadecimal number of exactly 32 digits.
        If the implementation was to be wrong (which is entirely possible in this example since I don't run or validate my example code) it would be much easier for a reader to spot the mistake.
      </p>
      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        We developers are inherently lazy and when confronted with a value we barely understand we oftentimes think we can <strong>sidestep the issue of naming completely by keeping the value anonymous.</strong>
        I know I've been guilty of coming up with no descriptive name for a variable so I just left it anonymous.
        Come code review time my coworker simply assumed I knew what I was doing in that one expression full of anonymous variables and approved the code.
        In the end my unreadable spaghetti made it to production because I was too unsure to name a variable and my coworker was too unsure to call me out on it.
        I invite you to be skeptical of every anonymous value you see and ask yourself "Is the role immediately obvious?" whether you're writing or reviewing code.
        If you're ever wondering whether a value's role is immediately obvious or not, it's likely not.
        A reader has much less context than the author on a specific piece of code.
        Err on the side of adding too many names instead of leaving too many variables anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion "anonymous" is oftentimes the least descriptive name you could give a variable.
        Unfortunately it is also the easiest name to give.
