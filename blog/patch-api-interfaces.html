      <p>
        Web developers have come up with no satisfying standard to settle what a
        PATCH request payload should look like. Should it match the shape of the
        resource being modified or should it be a list of operations to apply?
        There is no one satisfying answer. This article describes the problems
        in common PATCH API designs, their alternatives and the tradeoffs that
        apply to the viable ones.
      </p>
      <h2>Shallow Object Merge</h2>
      <p>
        The most common modern PATCH API design is a JSON shallow object merge.
        It mirrors the JavaScript spread operator:
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  ...resource,
  ...payload
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        It's intuitive to understand, even by developers unfamiliar with JS.
        Each property in the root of the patch object represents an overwrite
        operation on that property. The shape of the payload mirrors the shape
        of the resource being modified, often allowing developers to reuse
        validation logic from create endpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what's wrong with it? Above I specifically wrote
        <strong>root</strong>
        level, because nested object properties overwrite the whole property,
        not just individual sub-properties. This can defeat the purpose of a
        patch operation in some cases. If we wish to change the 8:00 event in
        the following resource, what payload should we send?
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "id": "schedule-id",
  "organizer": "organizer-id",
  "events": {
    "8:00": null,
    "10:00": "event-id-1",
    "12:00": "event-id-2"
  }
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>In a shallow merge design it would have to be</p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "events": {
    "8:00": "event-id-new",
    "10:00": "event-id-1",
    "12:00": "event-id-2"
  }
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        That's bad for two reasons. For one, the sender of the request must know
        the current value of events in order to update it. In some cases that
        might involve requesting the schedule resource just to patch it. Even
        when doing so, the delay between reading the value and applying the
        patch introduces race condition bugs. For example if someone had changed
        the 10:00 event during that time, their change would be unexpectedly
        reverted by ours.
      </p>
      <h2>Alternatives</h2>
      <p>
        Seeing the above counter-example you likely reacted with some variation
        of "couldn't we just…". Unfortunately, it's all tradeoffs from here on.
        Let's look at some commonly proposed alternatives.
      </p>
      <h3>Flatten It All</h3>
      <p>
        If we flatten the schedule object, then we don't have a nested object
        anymore.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "id": "schedule-id",
  "organizer": "organizer-id",
  "events.8:00": null,
  "events.10:00": "event-id-1",
  "events.12:00": "event-id-2"
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        Now the payload shape no longer matches the resource shape so we've lost
        some style points. More worryingly, a flattened object suffers from the
        same problems as…
      </p>

      <h3>Deep Object Merge</h3>

      <p>
        If the whole issue with shallow object merge was that its nested levels
        act differently than its root level, why not eliminate that discrepancy?
        Let's imagine another property on the schedule resource; a budget. A
        budget can be one of two shapes:
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "type": "MAXIMUM",
  "value": [Int]
}

{
  "type": "TARGET",
  "value": [Int]
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        In such a case, the following patch will always result in a valid
        budget.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "budget": { "value": 2000 }
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        However, APIs evolve. Let's say we want to introduce a new type of
        budget:
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "type": "UNLIMITED"
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        No value property, huh? The previously safe patch is now possibly
        invalid, meaning adding this new union member to a property's validation
        is a breaking change whereas it wouldn't in a shallow object merge
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider also how one would set an unlimited budget. Which of the
        following budget properties is correct?
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "type": "UNLIMITED"
}

{
  "type": "UNLIMITED",
  "value": null
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        I would say technically neither. This might be resolvable in a toy
        example but in the real world I've worked with unions of half a dozen
        types and partially overlapping properties. Deep object merge wrecks
        maintainability.
      </p>
      <h3>Series Of Operations</h3>
      <p>
        If either kind of object merge leads to trouble, maybe we can give up
        trying to mirror the shape of the resource in the payload and instead
        have the payload describe the changes to the resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been attempts to standardise patch operations to cover all
        cases for everybody. Most notable of these attempts is
        <a href="https://jsonpatch.com/" target="_blank">JSON Patch</a>. A JSON
        Patch request is a list of standardised operations to be applied to the
        resource in order and atomically. The complexity, compared to a shallow
        object merge is incomparable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would you be willing to fundamentally change the shape of your request
        payload to accommodate some problem case like the events property above?
        You'd have to rewrite <strong>all</strong> of your requests, not just
        the problematic ones. Besides, it doesn't even support array operations.
      </p>
      <h3>Array Operations</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are the worst when it comes to PATCH APIs. Even something as
        simple as appending an element breaks down in all of the above mentioned
        designs. There are dozens of array operations one might want to apply in
        a patch: append, remove if present, add if not present, move, sort,
        filter, map… Clearly, there are too many to standardise or to implement
        realistically.
      </p>
      <h3>My Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Here's some practical advice. Given the shallow object merge has so many
        desirable qualities and only breaks down in a minority of cases I'd like
        to start with it as a base. Later extending it with a mechanism to
        evolve the API design when shallow object merge is found wanting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my model each property of the payload can either be an overwriting
        value (like in shallow object merge) or an operation description, which
        is interpreted and applied.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
{
  "budget": {
    "type": "MAXIMUM",
    "value": 2000
  },
  "events": {
    "op": "merge",
    "value": {
      "8:00": "event-id-new"
    }
  }
}
</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        The events property is not overwritten but instead a merge operation is
        applied to it, shallow merging the value in the operation description
        into the property value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operations have to be predefined as available on a property and their
        implementation has to be defined by the API provider, although I suggest
        you keep some common conventions in your organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is to keep things evolvable. Don't define operations until you
        need them and only use them when needed. This ensures you can make
        changes to your API in a backwards compatible way. Changing patch
        strategies altogether is usually a breaking change but in this model
        adding a merge operation on events is entirely backwards compatible.
        Consumers of the API uninterested in the events property need not adapt.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not trying to start a standard here. I just think this is a neat
        pattern for when provider and consumer of a patch API are independently
        developed and backwards compatibility is key. You should consider it as
        a possible solution when shallow object merge isn't enough.
      </p>
      <h2>What If We Didn't Nest?</h2>
      <p>
        You may have felt throughout reading this article that the root problem
        isn't with patches or shallow object merge but instead with nested
        objects in resources. An event timestamp isn't a property of the
        schedule, but a relationship between the schedule and event. Give it its
        own resource type!
      </p>
      <p>
        I think nested objects have their place. They simplify validation rules
        as all cohesive properties are colocated. They avoid chicken-egg
        problems like a parent being invalid without any children but children
        requiring a parent to be created. Often the alternative to nested
        objects is a sparse data structure where many fields appear to be
        optional but are actually only used in a subset of resource types. I'd
        rather deal with occasional patch problems than deal with sparse data
        structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're unconvinced by my above arguments, let me present my ultimate
        trump-card as to why these patterns matter. Someone else already wrote
        an API with nested objects and now you have to maintain it.
      </p>
      <h2>Not Just Web APIs</h2>
      <p>
        I've presented the problems and solutions in terms of JSON payloads in
        an HTTP PATCH endpoint. However, the concepts discussed in this article
        generalise to any kind of patch API and any format that models similar
        objects. Whether you're using XML, YAML or even a basic struct, the same
        concepts apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't limit your thinking to APIs exposed over the internet. Similar
        patterns can occur between objects in your code structure. Reducers
        apply patch operations dispatched to them, some allow arbitrary
        functions, others only a shallow object merge. You'll see these patterns
        everywhere now.
