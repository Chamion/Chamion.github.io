        The typical user story in a software team involves contributions from
        multiple disciplines: product owners, engineers and designers. This
        article explores inefficiencies found in the hand-offs of work between
        software engineers and product designers, how these anti-patterns emerge
        and what to do about them.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Business-as-Usual">Business as Usual</h2>
      <p>
        Let's examine the usual lifecycle of a user story through an example. I
        will keep referring back to the example to give a practical illustration
        of concepts throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll use a particularly pathological story of engineer-design mismatch
        from my own experience. The team was tasked with creating a view where
        first-time users of the app can set up all the required settings before
        using the app. At the time they had to navigate around to multiple views
        in the app. Authorising the app to use their social media account,
        designating a payment method, inviting collaborators; stuff like that.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <div class="list-item-with-heading">
            <div>Discovery</div>
            <p>
              Determine which settings should be included in the onboarding view
              and whether they are required or optional. Performed by product
              managers and engineers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="list-item-with-heading">
            <div>Design</div>
            <p>
              Determine how the user sets their settings. Decide on a layout for
              the view. Define the look of all the elements involved and which
              links lead where. Performed by designers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="list-item-with-heading">
            <div>Technical Planning</div>
            <p>
              Determine what data must be fetched and from where for the view.
              Define required API endpoints and which components in the view use
              them. Determine how the solution will be validated and what done
              means. Performed by engineers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="list-item-with-heading">
            <div>Implementation</div>
            <p>
              Write the code, validate the solution and deploy it. Performed by
              engineers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Obviously this model only applies if some product design is involved in
        the user story. For the purposes of this article I'll assume there's
        design involved. None of the discussion is relevant to stories that
        require no design.
      </p>
      <h2 id="A-Picture-of-the-UI">A Picture of the UI</h2>
      <p>
        A design artefact, the document designers hand to engineers to guide
        frontend work, is often practically a screenshot of the intended UI. It
        shows the layout of elements and how components should be styled. As a
        design it still lacks a lot of elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        A frontend engineer will have to define what happens when a server
        request fails or how a component looks while it's still loading required
        data. Frontend engineers need to make a lot of decisions on which design
        artefacts seldom include guidance: tooltip copywriting, hover styles,
        animations, content overflow, context menu, scrollbars, error messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our example, the design was a wizard form; each step had to be
        submitted before the next could be accessed. It featured many new form
        control components and for each an initial and a value-filled state.
        That was two out of seven that I needed. Available options and already
        set values had to be loaded. loading either can fail, resulting in six
        combinations of loading, error or success pairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the wizard structure struck me as odd since only one of the
        settings was required to define another. All the other settings could be
        done in any order. The design was placing unnecessary restrictions on
        what users could do.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not that designers are sloppy or neglect to include necessary
        detail. A designer seldom has access to information such as which data
        is available at which state of the UI. They can't know if a
        &lt;select&gt; element's options are always available, loaded after page
        load or only loaded when a search query is entered.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Lets-Collaborate">Let's Collaborate</h2>
      <p>
        Engineers following a design artefact will have to make crucial design
        choices such as the ones listed above. Often designers have a better
        grasp of user behaviour and would be better equipped to make these
        decisions. Instead, engineers make the choices because tasks are done
        out-of-order.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our example, engineers ended up defining the missing states.
        Unsurprisingly, we didn't pick the same behaviours for analogous states
        or even consistent colours for our error icons. We had to go back and
        redo work to align the designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So should we swap design and planning in the timeline? Not quite. Design
        decisions affect plans. It's often useful for an engineer to know what
        the layouts look like. For example the division of steps in a form flow
        helps engineers plan which data is useful to prefetch.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our example, had I done the technical planning before seeing the
        design, I'd have written plans for a dashboard with links to the various
        parts of the app where the settings could be defined. My design had
        nothing in common with what designers were thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither side is equipped to make design decisions alone. The obvious
        solution is to collaborate on design decisions. Engineers and designers
        need a shared language they can use to refer to concepts using words
        that both sides understand to mean the same thing. Luckily such a
        language already exists.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Components">Components</h2>
      <p>
        Design systems are libraries of reusable components. Each component has
        predefined behaviour and styles. When a designer includes a component in
        a design, engineers know they should use the component from the design
        system, which comes with all the states and transitions already defined.
        This is the optimal outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can extend the concept of a component outside any design system. The
        form controls in our example are recognisable as components. As an
        engineer seeing them in the design I knew what questions I needed
        answers to, but it was too late for the designers to incorporate their
        answers into the design. They had already made decisions relying on
        assumptions that wouldn't hold in reality. In essence we want to define
        the components in a design as early as possible because both sides can
        meaningfully communicate facts about components and understand the other
        side.
      </p>
      <p>
        I propose engineers and designers should get together to define the
        components in a view at their most basic level. Gather around a
        whiteboard and draw boxes to define the desired views and components
        within them. At this level there is no point in getting any more
        detailed than when both sides agree on each box's name. I call this
        process “preliminary planning” just to have a word for it.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Revised-Model">Revised Model</h2>
      <p>Here's concretely the lifecycle model I prefer.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><div class="list-item-with-heading">Discovery</div></li>
        <li>
          <div class="list-item-with-heading">
            <div>Preliminary Design</div>
            <p>
              Debate design decisions such as wizard form vs. a single-view
              wizard vs. link dashboard. Define what the parts of the user
              interface are. Define the intended user journeys. Enumerate and
              write down the components. Performed by designers and engineers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="list-item-with-heading">
            <div>Technical Planning</div>
            <p>
              Same as before but the plans must include a list of states for the
              components that designers can reference. Performed by engineers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="list-item-with-heading">
            <div>Detailed Design</div>
            <p>
              Define the look of all the possible states enumerated in the
              technical plans. Performed by designers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li><div class="list-item-with-heading">Implementation</div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In a nutshell split the design step in two: first the phase where
        engineers need to be involved and later the part where designers are
        already provided with sufficient information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Involving engineers in the preliminary design and requiring them to
        communicate the states explicitly sounds like extra work. However, this
        is work that engineers end up doing ad-hoc in the existing model anyway.
        Collaborating early and communicating effectively reduces the need for
        revisions in designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discovery work makes for an apt analogy. Some ticket boards don't have a
        discovery column. User stories go straight to design and then to
        technical planning. In such cases engineers end up doing the discovery
        work anyway, but now they have to fit their new findings onto designs
        and plans that were both made on faulty assumptions. Likewise, designers
        end up doing multiple revisions because the information they needed is
        revealed to them too late.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Its-About-Management">It's About Management</h2>
      <p>
        Why do we do things the way I described at the start? In short,
        organisational structure. There is a clear and immediate benefit to the
        usual structure. A benefit that would be partially lost in my proposed
        model. Engineers and designers report to different managers. Their work
        is evaluated separately. When work is segregated, managers can much more
        effectively evaluate the performance of workers. When work is
        collaborative, it's more difficult to assign credit for good work.
        Managers need to identify performance signal from noisy observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think managers organise this way to make their work easier. The
        structure is much more likely just a default. Splitting work by team
        lines and throwing work items over the wall is the structure that
        naturally emerges if no deliberate planning goes into a structure. Both
        engineers and design teams communicate much more within teams than
        across teams. Convey's law would predict the observed structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a reason managers constantly urge workers to communicate across
        teams and “break silos”. It takes deliberate effort to do anything
        across team boundaries. If not consciously kept up, a collaborative
        workflow will degenerate back to throwing work items across a wall. A
        good way to keep an action conscious is to make it explicit. Add a
        “preliminary design” column to engineering teams' ticket boards. It
        explicitly reminds any engineer finishing discovery to reach out to a
        designer for preliminary design.
      </p>
      <p>
        To transform the collaboration model of your organisation you need
        buy-in from both engineering and design teams. They need to understand
        what the new workflow is and agree to execute it. This article ought to
        help with the former and I don't expect better results for less work
        overall to be a hard sell.
