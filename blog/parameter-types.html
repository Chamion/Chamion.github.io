        Should a parameter type constrain the parameter to what one expects to
        be passed into the method or what the method needs from the parameter?
        I've had the same debate with multiple software engineers. This article
        settles the debate and explores the history that explains its existence.
      </p>
      <h2>It depends</h2>
      <p>
        There are two types of type systems: nominal and structural. A nominal
        type system requires each interface be explicitly declared and for
        parameter types to include these same interfaces. Structural type
        systems use duck typing. As long as a parameter's type matches all the
        characteristics of an interface it's allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        No burying the lead; in a nominal type system constrain to what you
        expect, in a structural type system constrain to what the method needs.
        If you're writing Java, define descriptively named interfaces and refer
        to them in method definitions. If you're writing TypeScript, define the
        broadest possible interface in each method definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        You never hear Java developers argue over the matter. That's because
        they have no choice. They have to write explicit interfaces and keep
        referring to them. There is nothing, short of good sense, stopping a
        TypeScript developer mimicking that style of interface definition in
        their code. Programmers in structural type systems have a choice and
        writing maximally broad interfaces results in more maintainable code.
      </p>
      <h2>Nominal Types Lead To Unnecessary Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        Explicit interfaces force developers into implementing interface
        segregation. Interfaces are defined client-first and a method definition
        refers to these interfaces. This means there's a two-way relationship
        between the provider and consumers of functionality. If a change to an
        interface makes it incompatible with a method the compiler reports an
        error. That's preferred. If we wish to add a new usage of a method that
        new interface has to be added to the method definition. That sucks. A
        method definition is dependent on its usages. Code changes happen in two
        places for one reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        It gets worse. If a usage of a method is removed, there is no
        requirement the method definition be amended to reflect that. This means
        a method might be constrained by an interface that is never present at
        run-time. Over time code changes make the codebase harder to change,
        less maintainable. If you're a Java developer you might be thinking of a
        specific codebase right now.
      </p>
      <h2>Structural Types Allow For Maintainability</h2>
      <p>
        Structural types allow a parameter type to be maximally broad. This
        means any usage that technically works is allowed by the type system. If
        a new usage is added or removed, the method definition remains
        unchanged.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
getDisplayNameStrict(user: User) {
  return user.name ?? user.id;
}

getDisplayNameBroad(user: { name?: string; id: string }) {
  return user.name ?? user.id;
}</pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        The latter method can be called by any consumer whose use-case is
        compatible. Most likely that's going to be only two: your intended
        target use-case and your tests. But if more are introduced, you can
        re-use the code. It's easier to notice when two or more implementations
        are similar enough to extract into a shared utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Defining needless properties on parameter types is already annoying when
        testing. In the above strict example you'd probably write a user factory
        to define the irrelevant fields for your test. In the broad example you
        just pass an object expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the larger scale unnecessary properties become a spreading problem.
        Any consumer of the function will require all the extra properties. If
        they come from parameters then the consumer of that consumer must
        provide the parameters and so on recursively throughout the codebase.
        This can lead to parameters being passed at run-time just because an
        interface deep down the stack trace requires it in types only. In an
        aged codebase one might have entire columns in the database that are
        never used anywhere, just because the type interface has it such that
        any method referring to the interface also requires it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When parameter types are consistently as broad as possible any
        constraints in a method are only the union of all the requirements of
        the methods it calls and the requirements of the function body itself.
        This means it's a lot easier to try a refactoring and see if the new
        code is valid. No need to change types in multiple levels of method
        calls to make your new version fit. Multiple methods having to change
        for the sake of one method's change should already clue you in that
        there's a code quality problem.
      </p>
      <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
      <p>
        Programmers used to a nominal type system are drawn to defining
        descriptively named interfaces and referring to them in method calls
        even in a structural type system. Educational material and thought
        leaders in the past have largely defaulted to nominal type system
        languages, often Java. The lessons programmers hear regarding code
        quality often assumes nominal types so advice that is sound in a nominal
        type setting is given as generic, applying everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also a weird bias in the programming community's meme pool where
        strict type systems, often nominal, are seen as more professional than
        incomplete type systems like TypeScript or PHP. Programmers who make
        code decisions by vibing often prefer code that looks more like Java or
        C# even in contexts where it doesn't apply, like TypeScript or Python.
      </p>
      <h2>Remember To Refactor</h2>
      <p>
        Practically speaking it's uncomfortable to write a method without
        defining its parameter type first and I wouldn't advise you do it.
        Instead, annotate your parameter with the type you expect, write the
        implementation and then return to pare the parameter type free of any
        unnecessary properties. This way you get IDE support for your parameter:
        lists of available properties, autocomplete, links to definitions, AI
        assist.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you submit production code it should be a finished product. I don't
        mean functionally, but in terms of its developmental qualities it should
        be optimised for reading rather than writing. Take some care to prepare
        the presentation of your method with the reader in mind. The convenient
        available interfaces are there to help you but your software design
        decisions shouldn't be based on the autocomplete functionality in your
        IDE.
