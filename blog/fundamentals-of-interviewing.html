      <p>
        Advice regarding interviewing often devolves into descriptions of an
        author's favourite interview method with no justification as to why it's
        preferable. For example I've read advice that promoted developing a
        holistic view of each candidate. It sounds smart on the surface but
        fundamentally has no connection to the goals of interviewing. This
        article describes the fundamental goals of interviewing so you can
        better reason about interview methods.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        The primary objective of interviewing is to produce an evaluation of the
        candidate's objective quality. Usually an evaluation is binary:
        pass/fail. Some frameworks involve greater granularity but all
        evaluations are one-dimensional. The following properties determine the
        quality of an evaluation, i.e. whether the interviewer did a good job or
        not.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The evaluation has a positive correlation with candidate quality
        </li>
        <li>The evaluation can be compared to other evaluations</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The first property is obviously important. Candidate quality is the
        cumulative net business value the candidate would provide the company if
        hired. Accepting this definition does not require you subscribe to a
        world view where people have a measurable objective worth, only
        objective business value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second property is required for the evaluations to be useful in
        making hiring decisions. Evaluations that cannot be compared are useless
        to hiring managers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's appreciate for a moment properties that are not fundamentally
        required. The evaluation need not necessarily be justified in any way
        although practically speaking to correlate with candidate quality there
        has to be some touch point with reality. The evaluation also needs not
        be nuanced. It's explicitly the complexity of a human person reduced to
        a one-dimensional score.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that an evaluation is not the same as making a hiring decision.
        Hiring managers usually use multiple evaluations to make decisions. The
        evaluations are just one tool to help them make decisions. An
        interviewers job is not to decide whether a candidate should be hired or
        not.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Secondary-Objectives">Secondary Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        Producing an evaluation is the driving motivation for conducting an
        interview in the first place. Secondary objectives are a side-effect of
        interviews not happening in a vacuum. Since interviews interact with the
        rest of the world it's preferable the interactions are positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing a positive candidate experience leads to positive outcomes for
        the company as well. Candidates influence other prospective candidates
        in their networks. They might also wish to apply again in the future.
        Providing a positive candidate experience means you get more future
        applications and protect your company's reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another secondary objective is to minimize the cost of interviewing.
        Usually the greatest cost is the interviewers' time so reducing the
        duration of interviews and number of interviewers provides immediate
        savings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice the objectives can conflict. Enumerating the objectives
        explicitly helps reason about trade-offs. You can justify an interview
        method by arguing it serves one of the objectives without hurting the
        others too much.
      </p>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Interviewers get immediate feedback on how well they are doing with
        regard to the secondary objectives. However, interviewers seldom get any
        feedback on the quality of their evaluations. Couple this with the lack
        of advice and the fact interviewing is usually a secondary task for an
        interviewer, not what they were hired to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interviewer who does not consciously seek to improve their
        interviewing skills will naturally adopt behaviours that serve the
        secondary objectives at the expense of the primary objective.
        Interviewers can save time by skipping preparation for an interview and
        if they're never held accountable this behaviour will not be corrected.
        More insidiously, interviewers can adopt behaviours that make them feel
        better during an interview, such as providing excessive assistance to a
        candidate or interpreting answers to fit their own biases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of feedback means experience alone will not naturally teach
        interviewers to be better at the task. Interviewers must deliberately
        seek to make good evaluations. Luckily interviewers, like most people,
        generally want to do a good job even if they aren't held accountable.
        Simply making interviewers aware of what makes an evaluation good will
        remedy most of the bad behaviour described above.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Practice">Practice</h2>
      <p>
        From the fundamental objectives we can derive more practical principles
        such as the following.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Reduce bias as much as possible. Biases reduce the correlation between
          candidate quality and evaluation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the interview process fast. A faster process is less costly and
          less cumbersome to candidates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the interview process appear fair. Candidates who perceive a
          rejection to be their own failing have a better experience than
          candidates who attribute it to luck or the interviewer.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These are still really generic but you can justify specific interview
        methods with them. For example a repeatable process such as using the
        same interview questions for all candidates reduces bias. Cutting out
        interview questions that don't help make an evaluation shortens an
        interview. Using an interview process that candidates can reasonably
        expect feels more fair than something bespoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any piece of interviewing advice can be evaluated by considering whether
        it contributes to the fundamental objectives. For example advice about
        forming a holistic view of a candidate is entirely unrelated to the
        objectives. It's not actively harmful but it's not helpful either.
        Question each aspect of your interview process and try to answer how it
        contributes to one of the objectives. If you can't come up with an
        answer you've identified an area for improvement.
